User Flow:
	The first thing that will happen for the user is they will come to a feed of all new workouts that have been added to the API. From there they can click the individual workout or they can choose to filter the workouts which they see in the feed. The filter button will send the user to a new View Controller which will allow the user to filter the way they workout. For instance, if they want to work out their legs, outside, a bunch of workouts with these specifications would then appear in the feed. 
	The Workout Detail View Controller will show the workout. A user will be able to see how many sets, reps and the exercise which they should perform. There will be an ‘Add To Calendar’ button and an ‘Add to Journal’ button. If the user clicks ‘Add To Calendar’ a calendar will appear and the user will be able to add the workout to any date on their workout calendar. Hopefully, I will be able to sync this Workout Calendar with their local calendar on their phone. The ‘Add To Journal’ will pull up a journal where the user can see past workouts, and add additional workouts which the user can add for a specific workout. For instance, if they want to write the weight they did for their sets, they can edit it there in there journal.
