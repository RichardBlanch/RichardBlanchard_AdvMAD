Userflow:

The opening page of my app will be a list of restaurants which are close to the users location. However, this may be a little difficult for me because I have not worked with location services on Android. A user will then be able to click on a restaurants and view more information about the restaurant. This will be things such as hours, menu, phone number etc. From there there will be a link so the user can click on the website and it will open up in their browser.
